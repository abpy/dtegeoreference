dtegeoreference
===============

approximate georeferencing of the DTE aerial photo collection

original wayne state university source of maps and images: http://www.clas.wayne.edu/photos/ap_index.htm

"img overlay.py" can be used with out knowledge of programming.
can only be used for counties that have been georeferenced (macomb, oakland)

output is google earth image overlay .kml and .jpg

georeferencing is only approximate, manual adjustment is necessary.

please note some code is in a rough state and unpolished
